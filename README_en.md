**CPM-Bee** is a fully open-source, commercially-usable Chinese-English bilingual base model with a capacity of one hundred billion parameters. It is the second milestone achieved through the training process of [**CPM-live**](https://live.openbmb.org/).
Utilizing the Transformer auto-regressive architecture, CPM-Bee has been pre-trained on an extensive corpus of trillion-scale tokens, thereby possessing remarkable foundational capabilities.



## ‚ú® Features

- **üëê Open-source and Commercial Usable**ÔºöOpenBMB adheres to the spirit of open-source, aiming to make large-scale models accessible to everyone. CPM-Bee, as a foudation model, is fully open-source and available for commercial use, contributing to the advancement of the field of large-scale models.

- **üí´ Excellent Performance in Chinese and English**Ôºö : CPM-Bee's base model has undergone rigorous selection and balancing of pre-training data, resulting in outstanding performance in both Chinese and English. For detailed information regarding evaluation tasks and results, please refer to the assessment documentation.


- **üìñ Vast and High-quality Corpus**Ôºö CPM-Bee, as a base model, has been trained on an extensive corpus of over trillion tokens, making it one of the models with the highest volume of training data within the open-source community. Furthermore, we have implemented stringent selection, cleaning, and post-processing procedures on the pre-training corpus to ensure its quality.

- **<img src="https://i.imgloc.com/2023/05/21/V4nLS3.png" width="20px"> Support for OpenBMB System**Ôºö The OpenBMB system provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and scripts for high-performance pre-training, adaptation, compression, deployment, and tool development. CPM-Bee, as a base model, is accompanied by all the necessary tool scripts, enabling developers to efficiently utilize and explore advanced functionalities.


- **üî® Conversational and Tool Usage Capabilities**Ôºö Building upon OpenBMB's exploration in instruction-based fine-tuning and tool learning, we have performed fine-tuning on top of the CPM-Bee base model, resulting in an instance model with powerful conversational and tool usage capabilities. The API and beta testing for this model will be made available in the near future.

## üöÄ Setup and Use

### Environment Setup
Clone the CPM-Bee repositoryÔºö
```bash
$ git clone -b main --single-branch https://github.com/OpenBMB/CPM-Bee.git
```
Please ensure the environment to meet the following requirements:
```bash
- python>=3.7
- torch>=1.10
```

We recommend using Anaconda to manage your environment and install CPM-Bee and other dependencies from PyPI:
```bash
$ cd src
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py install
```
`bmtrain` is the key dependency of CPM-Bee. If you meet some difficulties when installing `bmtrain`, you can refer to [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain) and choose appropriate version of torch and CUDA.

### File Preparation
In order to quickly familiarize you with the CPM-Bee model, we suggest that you prepare the model configuration file and parameter file first. You can find configuration file in [`src/config/cpm-bee-10b.json`](https://github.com/OpenBMB/CPM-Bee/blob/main/src/config/cpm-bee-10b.json), and download parameter file [here](10b Model Link)

### Quick Use
After preparing the configuration file and parameter file, you can refer to the following code to quickly use the CPM-Bee model:
```python
>>> import torch
>>> from cpm_live.models import CPMBeeTorch, CPMBeeConfig
>>> from cpm_live.tokenizers import CPMBeeTokenizer
>>> from cpm_live.generation.bee import CPMBeeBeamSearch
>>> tokenizer = CPMBeeTokenizer()
>>> model = CPMBeeTorch(CPMBeeConfig.from_json_file("/your/config"))
>>> model.load_state_dict(torch.load("/your/model/checkpoint"))
>>> model.cuda()
>>> inputs = {"input": "‰ªäÂ§©Â§©Ê∞îÁúüÂ•ΩÔºå<mask>", "<ans>": ""}
>>> beam_search = CPMBeeBeamSearch(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
>>> inference_results = beam_search.generate([inputs], max_length=100)
>>> print(inference_results[0]["<ans>"])
ÂøÉÊÉÖ‰πüÂæàÂ•Ω
```

### Extend Task
- The CPM-Bee base model excels at accurate semantic understanding and efficiently handles various fundamental tasks, including text completion, text generation, translation, question answering, sentiment analysis, multiple-choice questions, and more.

```

### Fine-tuing Procedure
If you are not satisfied with inference tests and want to fine-tune the model on a particular task, you should prepare the data set and do so as followsÔºö
- Reformat Data

You can integrate classification questions into the format of multiple choice questions. For more information about the data format, you can see [CPM-Bee DataFormat](#extend-task). Suppose you have the following data:
```bash
|-- your/reformated/data/path
    | -- train.json
    | -- eval.json
```
- Process the dataset to binary file„ÄÇ

To build dataset, you can run
```bash
$ python preprocess_dataset.py --input your/reformated/data/path --output_path your/binary/data/path --output_name data_name
```

After processÔºåyou can obtain the data as followsÔºö
```
|-- your/binary/data/path
    |-- train
    |    |-- data_name
    |    |-- meta.bin
    |-- eval
         |-- data_name
         |-- meta.bin
```
- Fine-tune CPM-Bee

To begin fine-tuning, you can runÔºö
``` bash
$ bash scripts/finetune_cpm_bee.sh
```
Or you can run `finetune_cpm_bee.py` directly from `torchrun`. For example, you can fine-tune CPM-Bee on a server with 4 Gpus, as shown below
```bash
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 --rdzv_id=1 --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=localhost:12345 finetune_cpm_bee.py \
--model-config your/model/config/path \
--load your/model/checkpoint/path \
--dataset your/binary/data/path/train \
--eval_dataset your/binary/data/path/eval \
--use-delta 
```
We provide the arguments like `eval-interval`, `early-stop-patience`Ôºåby which you can choose appropriate arguments configuration according to your own dataset.

Leveraging the ecosystem of the OpenBMB large model system, we have implemented an efficient end-to-end training process for CPM-Bee. Additionally, we provide a complete set of scripts for various tasks, including continued training (using BMTrain), fine-tuning (using OpenPrompt and OpenDelta), tool usage (using BMTools), model compression (using BMCook), and efficient inference (using BMinf). These scripts are designed to assist developers in quickly getting started with and utilizing CPM-Bee effectively.

### Pre-training

We provide a pre-training [script](https://github.com/OpenBMB/CPM-Bee/blob/main/src/pretrain_cpm_bee.py) based on [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain) to improve the efficiency of training.

### Fine-tuning

Based on [OpenDelta](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenDelta), we provide two solutions of model tuning: full-parameter fine-tuning and parameter-efficient delta tuning, which could adapt CPM-Bee to various of scenarios.

1. Full-parameter fine-tuning:
```bash
$ torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 --rdzv_id=1 --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=localhost:12345 finetune_cpm_bee.py
```

2. Parameter-efficient delta tuningÔºö
```bash
$ torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 --rdzv_id=1 --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=localhost:12345 finetune_cpm_bee.py \
--use-delta \
```

### Model Compression

Based on [BMCook](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMCook), we have compressed the original CPM-Bee base model, offering multiple sizes of CPM-Bee models to accommodate various scenarios.

### Deployment


For the compressed CPM-Bee models, regular consumer-grade GPUs are sufficient for fast inference. The resource utilization for different sizes of models is as follows:

You can configure different input formats to accommodate different inference tasks.


## üí´ Performance

### Zero-shot

We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the CPM-Bee base model's Chinese and English language capabilities. In the Chinese Zero-CLUE benchmark, CPM-Bee outperformed other models considerably, ranking first among large Chinese models. In the English benchmark, CPM-Bee demonstrated comparable performance to the open-source model LLaMA.

### CPM-Bee+ Decoder Tuning

Using the [Decoder Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08408) method developed jointly by OpenBMB and THUNLP (to be published at ACL 2023), it is possible to significantly improve the performance of downstream tasks solely through the use of APIs, without accessing or modifying the model parameters. This approach ensures both professionalism and fluency in achieving the desired results.
